# Synchronization

 Implementing a solution to the classic Dining Philosophers Problem using either POSIX mutex locks and condition variables in C/C++ or Java condition variables. The problem models five philosophers who alternate between thinking and eating while sharing a limited set of five forks, requiring synchronization to prevent deadlock and starvation. Each philosopher runs as a separate thread and sleeps for a random period (1-3 seconds) to simulate thinking and eating.
